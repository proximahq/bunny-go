# Bunny.net Go client

This project aims to be an unofficial client for the [Bunny.net API](https://docs.bunny.net/reference/bunnynet-api-overview). 
The project is still in development and not ready for production use.

_This is a fork-off of the [bunny-go package](https://github.com/simplesurance/bunny-go)_
